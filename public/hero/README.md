# Hero imagery

Supplied by the owner on 2026-08-07 (`jaminpropertiesherosectionimages.zip`),
converted to responsive WebP. The originals were 16.6 MB of PNG; this set is
under 1 MB in total.

Serve with a `srcset` of the three widths and an explicit `width`/`height`, so
the hero contributes nothing to CLS.

## Brand imagery only

These are conceptual renders, not photographs of Jamin Bazaar projects — one
shows a high-rise skyline unrelated to Erode, Salem or Tiruppur. Under the
master brief sections 42 and 74 they may be used as abstract hero and brand
backgrounds only. They must **never** be captioned as a Jamin project, used on
a property card, or placed in a project gallery. Anything that claims to show a
Jamin project must use the real photography already in Supabase storage.

## Two families, and why it decides the treatment

The set is not one look. Which `PageHero` tone an image gets is a property of
the artwork, not a matter of taste — get it the wrong way round and either the
type stops being legible or the picture stops being worth showing.

**Photographic (1, 2, 3)** — real tonal range, deep skies, golden hour. These
carry white type across a full bleed, so they get `tone="cinematic"`: the image
fills the section and the `veil` scrim holds the copy at AA.

**Graphic (4–10)** — near-white ground with red architectural line-work, half
wireframe and half finished building. Laid full-bleed these need a heavy scrim,
which flattens the very thing that makes them good, and the near-white ground
gives white type nothing to sit on. They get `tone="paper"`: the words sit on
the page's ivory and `hero-fade` dissolves the image's left edge into it.

## Current assignments

**One image per page — no render appears twice.** Corrected 2026-08-08: hero-09
was on both /journal and /downloads, and hero-10 on both /contact and
/projects/completed, while hero-07 sat unused on a page that is never built.

**Three surfaces deliberately use no render at all**, which is what makes the
one-image-per-page arithmetic work — and is what the "brand imagery only" rule
above asks for on pages whose subject is a real project:

| surface | image | why not a render |
|---|---|---|
| /projects | 2nd photo of a development | index of real projects; hero-05 is needed on the homepage, where it literally illustrates "from sanctioned drawing to a plot you stand on" |
| /projects/completed | 2nd photo of the delivered project | its subject IS a delivered project |
| homepage closing band | 2nd photo of the delivered project | was hero-02, which is the /properties hero — the same frame twice in one visit |

⚠️ Always the **second** photograph, never `images[0]`. The first is the card
cover, and each of these pages also lists that project as a card, so using the
cover would put the same frame in the hero and the grid below it.

## The shortfall is closed (2026-08-08)

Three more renders were supplied, which ends the arithmetic problem recorded
here before: eleven hero surfaces against ten images.

- **hero-11 → /projects/current.** That stage had no image of its own and would
  have fallen back to hero-05, doubling with /projects, the moment a property
  was moved into it. It is now covered before it is ever used.
- **hero-12 → /account/sign-in**, which a bug report called visually empty.
- **hero-15 → the homepage** (2026-08-08, final swap). A 3000x2000 source, so
  every rendition is a genuine downscale — hero-14 before it was 748x421 and had
  to be upscaled to fill a desktop hero, which is why it read soft. hero-14 is
  retired for that reason alone.

  ⚠️ **It needed a second scrim, and the value was swept rather than guessed.**
  The photograph is bright from the horizon down — sunlit palms exactly where
  the headline sits — so on the shared `veil` alone the h1 measured 2.11 against
  2.73 for the frame it replaced, even though the lead paragraph improved. A
  frame-specific bottom wash was added to the homepage hero ONLY, leaving the
  audited `veil` untouched for every other cinematic page. Sweep:
  0.45/0.20 → 2.47 · 0.50/0.30 → 2.68 · **0.55/0.38 → 2.86** · 0.60/0.45 → 3.02.
  Shipped at 0.55/0.40: the first setting that clears the previous frame.
  Going further flattened the picture, which is what it was chosen for.

- **hero-13** is spare again.
- **hero-03 is now the spare** — the golden-hour render it replaced. Any new
  page that opens with a `PageHero` should take that rather than reuse an id.

### ⚠️ On measuring the veil against a new frame

Before swapping the homepage frame, hero-13 was compared with hero-03 by
compositing both through a canvas with the veil's two gradients and reading the
95th-percentile background luminance under the h1 and the lead. They came out
equivalent — h1 1.21 vs 1.11, lead 2.37 vs 2.37 — which is the useful result:
the new frame carries the same risk as the audited one already in place.

**Those absolute figures are NOT a contrast audit.** The reconstruction does not
reproduce the ≈0.89 combined alpha recorded in globals.css, most likely because
the 100deg gradient is approximated as an axis-aligned one. Treat this method as
a COMPARISON between frames only. A real audit has to measure the composited
page, not a model of it.
